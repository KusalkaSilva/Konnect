#University Group Project
Konnect is designed to fill the gap of information sharing between universities and the organizations in the industry. Konnect has created a platform for undergraduates, universities and industries to collaborate together by publishing information such as ideas and news related to events held in both parties.

This is a Java web project with MySQL database. Done as an assignment for our Development of Enterprise Application (DEA) module (2nd year). This project basically does event management (at elementary level). Built with JSP, Servlets and Java beans with MVC architecture in mind. This project is for Netbeans IDE running on Glassfish 4.1.1. For designing purposes Bootstrap 3.3.7 and Fullcalendar is used.
